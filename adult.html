                          <p class="tittle">Come see for yourself how our Karate classes combine the best of the best from classical, practical and tactical martial arts styles into an efficient and effective system of self defense.
                            Although our techniques are based on centuries old knowledge, our application of that knowledge sets The mukti martial arts Academy apart from the other schools. We realize that each student possesses different physical abilities. Size and strength varies with each individual, so once a student has acquired a strong foundation in the basics, our program will enhance his or her personal physical capabilities and maximize their self-defense skills. They will understand exactly what it takes, mentally and physically, to defend themselves should the need ever arise! Best of all our programs are packed with fun as students meet new friends and increase their knowledge about the human body while they learn!

                        <p class="tittle">Kata is a Japanese word describing detailed patterns of movements practiced either solo or in pairs. Karate kata are executed as a specified series of a variety of moves, with stepping and turning, while attempting to maintain perfect form. The kata is not intended as a literal depiction of a mock fight, but as a display of transition and flow from one posture and movement to another, teaching the student proper form and position, and encouraging them to visualize different scenarios for the use of each motion and technique. Karateka "read" a kata in order to explain the imagined events, a practice known as Bunkai. There are various kata, each with many minor variations.</p>

                        <h4 class="text-center">KUMITE</h4>
                <p class="tittle">Kumite literally translated means "grappling hands" and is one of the three main sections of karate training, along with kata and kihon. Kumite is the part of karate in which a person trains against an adversary, using the techniques learned from the kihon and kata. 
                  Kumite can be used to develop a particular technique or a skill (e.g. effectively judging and adjusting one's distance from one's opponent) or it can be done in competition.
